0. Introduction
This style guide aims to provide clear and consistent guidelines for writers and editors, ensuring that the publication maintains its distinctive voice, tone, and editorial standards.

1. Silhouette and Shape
1.1 Silhouette Suitability
1.1.1 The silhouette must align with the outfit’s intent and style, whether minimalist, oversized, tailored, or layered.
1.1.2 Relaxed fits should avoid appearing shapeless; ensure oversized pieces are offset with fitted elements.
1.1.3 Layering must follow a logical cascade of lengths, with longer pieces underneath shorter ones unless intentionally subverted.
1.2 Proportional Balance
1.2.1 Proportions must respect the wearer’s frame, avoiding imbalance in volume or line placement.
1.2.2 Adhere to the rule of thirds, visually dividing the outfit into top, middle, and bottom sections to avoid halving the silhouette.
1.2.3 Vertical emphasis, such as high-waisted pants or longline coats, elongates the figure, while horizontal lines like cropped jackets shorten it.

2. Color Palette and Coordination
2.1 General Color Harmony
2.1.1 Colors must complement the outfit's intended mood and setting, with palettes ranging from bold and vibrant to neutral and understated.
2.1.2 Ensure the dominant, secondary, and accent colors are distributed harmoniously. For example, a bright yellow top pairs well with neutral pants and subtle accessories.
2.2 Style-Specific Color Rules
2.2.1 Monochromatic outfits should incorporate varied textures or shades to avoid looking flat (e.g., a white linen shirt with white denim).
2.2.2 Streetwear thrives on bold contrasts (e.g., neon green and black), but muted palettes (beige, olive) can offer a more subdued edge.
2.2.3 Business attire should lean on neutral tones (e.g., navy, charcoal) with occasional pops of color in accessories like ties or scarves.
2.3 Seasonal Color Choices
2.3.1 Evaluate the suitability of colors to the season: warm tones for autumn (e.g., burnt orange, ochre) and pastel or cool shades for spring (e.g., lilac, mint).
2.3.2 Transitional pieces should balance darker and lighter shades for mid-season appropriateness.

3. Texture and Fabric Play
3.1 Texture Integration
3.1.1 Combine textures thoughtfully: juxtapose rougher materials like denim or wool with smoother ones like silk or satin for contrast.
3.1.2 Overly similar textures (e.g., all-cotton looks) may appear flat; incorporate a variety to elevate the outfit.
3.2 Fabric Quality and Practicality
3.2.1 Fabrics should suit the outfit's context: breathable and lightweight materials for summer, and heavier, insulating fabrics for winter.
3.2.2 Technical fabrics in athleisure or streetwear (e.g., Gore-Tex, mesh) should balance function and style without appearing overly utilitarian.

4. Print and Pattern Integration
4.1 Print Balance
4.1.1 Prints should be scaled to the garment and the wearer’s proportions: small patterns like micro-checks work well for fitted shirts, while larger prints suit casualwear or statement pieces.
4.1.2 Avoid clashing patterns unless deliberate; mixed prints (e.g., florals and stripes) must share a unifying element like color.
4.2 Pattern Placement
4.2.1 Ensure patterns or graphics draw attention to the desired focal point, such as a graphic logo on a hoodie or bold florals on a statement dress.
4.2.2 Prints used in professional wear (e.g., pinstripes, houndstooth) should remain symmetrical and refined.

5. Style-Specific Guidelines
5.1 Streetwear
5.1.1 Layering should look effortless but intentional, with oversized or stacked elements balanced by fitted pieces.
5.1.2 Sneakers, caps, or hoodies must align with the overall palette and avoid overpowering the outfit.
5.2 Business Formal
5.2.1 Suits must fit sharply at the shoulders and waist, with clean lines extending from the jacket to the pants.
5.2.2 Accessories like ties and pocket squares should add subtle flair without detracting from the polished look.
5.3 Bohemian
5.3.1 Flowing, unstructured pieces should feel cohesive rather than random. Layers should create a sense of lightness.
5.3.2 Earthy tones like terracotta or sage work best, with accents like fringe, embroidery, or crochet adding texture.
5.4 Retro/Vintage
5.4.1 Vintage pieces must feel current by pairing them with modern counterparts (e.g., retro blouses with contemporary denim).
5.4.2 Color palettes and accessories should match the referenced era while avoiding costume-like excess.

6. Accessory Use and Placement
6.1 Role of Accessories
6.1.1 Accessories should serve as accents, enhancing but not overshadowing the outfit.
6.1.2 Evaluate functionality: Bags and belts must align with both the style and the occasion (e.g., a sleek leather briefcase for business).
6.2 Jewelry
6.2.1 Jewelry must complement the outfit's tone: delicate chains for formal looks, bold statement pieces for casual or edgy styles.

7. Footwear Integration
7.1 Footwear Fit and Style
7.1.1 Footwear should align with the outfit’s category and balance its overall shape (e.g., chunky sneakers for casual, slim loafers for tailored looks).
7.1.2 Neutral-toned shoes offer versatility, while bold footwear can act as a statement piece when the rest of the outfit is muted.
7.2 Seasonal and Contextual Considerations
7.2.1 Evaluate appropriateness for weather and terrain: Boots for winter and breathable flats for summer.
7.2.2 Practicality must not sacrifice style; even rainwear (e.g., waterproof boots) can look chic with clean design lines.

8. Practicality and Seasonal Adaptation
8.1 Weather Suitability
8.1.1 Winter fits should emphasize warmth while maintaining a clean silhouette through strategic layering (e.g., fitted thermal coats).
8.1.2 Summer outfits must prioritize breathable fabrics and light tones for comfort.
8.2 Day-to-Night Versatility
8.2.1 Outfits should adapt to the wearer’s daily needs, such as swapping casual shoes for heels to elevate a smart-casual ensemble.

9.1 Strengths Evaluation
9.1.1 Highlight effective elements like balanced proportions, cohesive palettes, or unique textures.
9.1.2 Praise intentional details, such as thoughtfully chosen accessories or innovative layering.
9.2 Improvement Suggestions
9.2.1 Offer actionable feedback on areas like a new clothing item, piece replacement, color balance.
